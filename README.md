# Privacy-Preserving _NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies_

This repository contains a preliminary investigation into whether program synthesis techniques are amenable to differential privacy. Specifically, we examine whether the exponential mechanism can sample from set of candidate solutions produced by program synthesis (NEAT, in this case), reliably achieving high accuracy in the sampled solution with a small privacy loss.
